<h1>Systems with one degree of freedom</h1>
Note that this section does not assume a Galilean structure:
for one,
systems with one degree of freedom operate in 1-dimensional spaces whereas Galilean structures operate on 3-dimensional spaces
(looking just at their \(\bfx\)-component, i.e. without time dimension).
Moreover, no invariance under Galilean transformations is used here.

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<h3>Comments</h3>
Regarding the sign in the definition of the potential energy \(U(x)\):
whether \(U\) is a monotonically increasing function of \(x\) depends on \(f\).
In the cases where \(f\) has negative values in the relevant range,
\(U\) is indeed monotonically increasing with \(x\).
This, in particular, hold for the potential energy of a stone
(since the acceleration is towards the ground),
in accordance to the text.
<p>
To show that adding a constant to the potential energy does not change the equation of motion (1),
consider a potential energy \(U(x) = -\int_{x_0}^{x}f(\xi)d\xi\),
and let \(C\in\R\) be a constant.
Since
$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left(U(x)+C\right) = \frac{d}{dx}U(x)=f(x),
$$
we see that \(U(x)+C\) gives rise to the same equation (1).

<h3>Behavior under 1-dimensional Galilean transformations</h3>
The above-mentioned 1-dimensional analog of the Galilean group is the group generated by the following transformations:
<ul>
    <li>Uniform motion with velocity \(v\in\R\): \(U_{v}(t,x) = (t,x+v t)\).</li>
    <li>Translation by a vector \((t_0,x_0)\in\Rtwo\): \(T_{(t_0,x_0)}(t,x) = (t+t_0,x+x_0)\).</li>
    <li>Rotation by \(G\in\mathbf{O}_1(\R)\): \(R_G(t,x) = (t,Gx)\).
        Note that the only non-trivial rotation is \(G=-1\).
    </li>
</ul>
Let \(\ddot{x}=f(x)\) be a system with one degree of freedom.
As in Section 1.E.1,
requiring this system to comply with the 1-dimensional analog of the principle of relativity
translates into the following conditions:
<ul>
    <li>\(f\) does not depend on \(t\).</li>
    <li>\(f\) depend only on relative \(x\)- and \(\dot{x}\)-coordinates rather than on absolute \(x\)- and \(\dot{x}\)-coordinates.</li>
    <li>\(f(-x)=-f(x)\).</li>
</ul>
The first two conditions are met trivially by \(f\) by virtue of being a function of the single variable \(x\).
Thus the only real requirement here is for \(f\) to be an odd function.
-->

<h3>The law of conservation of energy</h3>
A couple of observations:
<ul>
    <li>
        The key to the proof of the law of conservation of energy is the existance of a potential energy function \(U(x)\)
        which statisfies \(d\,U/dx=-f\).
        Such a function always exists when there is one degree of freedom (assuming that \(f\) is integrable),
        but does not necessarliy exist in higher dimensions.
    </li>
    <li>
        As noted above no Galilean structure is assumed,
        thus the law of conservation of energy holds for all systems with one degree of freedom
        regardless of any Galilean structure context.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Phase flow</h2>
<h3>Notation</h3>
We denote the \(x\)- and \(y\)-coordinates of motion \(\bfvphi:\R\rightarrow\Rtwo\) by \(\bfvphi_x,\bfvphi_y\),
respectively.
<h3>Comments</h3>
The phase velocity vector field is determined by the right-hand side of both equations in (2),
i.e. it is the vector field defined by
$$
(x,y)\mapsto(y,f(x)).
$$
<p></p>
Let \(\bfvphi:\R\rightarrow\Rtwo\) be a motion solving equation (2).
Then \(\dot{\bfvphi} = \left(\dot{\bfvphi_x}, \dot{\bfvphi_y}\right) = \left(\bfvphi_y,f(\bfvphi_x)\right)\),
so we see that the velocity of the moving point of \(\bfvphi\) at each moment of time
is indeed equal to the phase velocity vector at the location of the phase point at that moment.

<h3>Problem: the uniqueness of a phase curve through a phase point</h3>
<proof>
Let \(\vphi,\vphi'\) be two motions whose phase curves pass through the same phase point \((x_0,y_0)\):
<p></p>
\begin{align}
\vphi(t_0) & = (x_0,y_0), \\
\vphi'(t'_0) & = (x_0,y_0).
\end{align}
Define another motion \(\psi(t)=\vphi'(t+\Delta t)\) where \(\Delta t = t'_0-t_0\).
Then
$$
\ddot{\psi_x}(t)=\ddot{\vphi'_x}(t+\Delta t)=f\left(\vphi'_x(t+\Delta t)\right)=f(\psi_x(t)),
$$
implying that \(\psi\) is another motion solving (2).
But \(\psi(t_0)=\vphi'(t'_0)=(x_0,y_0)\),
so by uniqueness of the solution of an ordinary differential equation with given initial conditions we see that \(\psi = \vphi\).
But \(\psi\) and \(\vphi'\) have the same phase curve, so this completes the proof.
