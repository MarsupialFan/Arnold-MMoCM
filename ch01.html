<h2>Affine spaces</h2>

<h3>A Notation</h3>
We will denote an element of \(\Gn\) as \((x,\bfx)\) where \(x\in\R\) and \(\bfx\in\Rn\).
<p></p>
<b>Claim</b> Let \(\mathbf{A}\) be an affine \(n\)-space and \(a_0,a_1,a_2\in\mathbf{A}\). Then
$$(a_2-a_1) = (a_2-a_0)-(a_1-a_0)$$
in \(\Rn\).
<p></p>
Proof - by definition \((a_1-a_0)\) is the (unique) element of \(\Rn\) such that
\(a_0+(a_1-a_0)=a_1\). Similarly \(a_0+(a_2-a_0)=a_2\) and \(a_1+(a_2-a_1)=a_2\).
We therefore get
\begin{align}
a_0+\left((a_2-a_1)+(a_1-a_0)\right) & = a_0+\left((a_1-a_0)+(a_2-a_1)\right) \\
& = \left(a_0+(a_1-a_0)\right)+(a_2-a_1) \\
& = a_1+(a_2-a_1) \\
& = a_2
\end{align}
so by uniqueness we get
\(a_2-a_0=(a_2-a_1)+(a_1-a_0)\). This gives the desired result.
<h3>Affine transformations</h3>
It is worthwhile recalling the definition of affine transformations.
A bijection \(f:\mathbf{A}\rightarrow\mathbf{A}\) (here \(\mathbf{A}\) is an affine \(n\)-space)
is an affine transformation if the map \(g:\Rn\rightarrow\Rn\) defined by \(g(v)=f(x+v)-f(x)\)
for every \(x\in\mathbf{A}\) is:
<ul>
    <li>Well defined, i.e. does not depend on the choice of \(x\)</li>
    <li>A linear transformation of \(\Rn\).</li>
</ul>
Note that the definition of \(g\) above
can be written as \(g(y-x)=f(y)-f(x)\) for every \(x,y\in\mathbf{A}\).

<h3>B Galilean structure</h3>
It is important to note that galilean transformations do not necessarily preserve the affine structure.
That is, a galilean transformation on a galilean space \(\mathbf{A}^4\) might not commute with parallel
displacements.
E.g. as we will see below
in the case of the galilean space \(\G\)  uniform motion and rotation galilean transformations
do not always commute with the parallel displacements (which are the translations \(T_{(s,\bfs)}\)).
Thus in order for \(g:\mathbf{A}^4\rightarrow\mathbf{A}^4\) to be a galilean transformation it
needs to statisfy the following two conditions:
<ul>
    <li>It must preserve time intervals: \(t(g(a),g(b))=t(a,b)\) for every \(a,b\in\mathbf{A}^4\).</li>
    <li>It must preserve distances between simultaneous events: \(\rho(g(a),g(b))=\rho(a,b)\)
        for every two simultaneous events \(a,b\in\mathbf{A}^3\).
        Note that the distance \(\rho(g(a),g(b))\) is well defined
        because \(g\) preserves time intervals and therefore \(g(a)\) and \(g(b)\)
        are simultaneous if \(a\) and \(b\) are.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>The basic Galilean transformations on \(\G\)</h4>
We will use a different notation for the basic Galilean (motion, translation, and rotation)
transformations than the one used in the book in order to make the parameters more explicit:
<ul>
<li>Uniform motion with velocity \(\bfv\in\Rthree\):
    $$U_{\bfv}(t,\bfx) = g_1(t,\bfx) = (t,\bfx+\bfv t)$$
</li>
<li>Translation by a vector \((s,\bfs)\in\G\):
    $$T_{(s,\bfs)}(t,\bfx) = g_2(t,\bfx) = (t+s,\bfx+\bfs)$$
</li>
<li>Rotation by an orthogonal matrix \(G\in\mathbf{O}_3(\R)\):
    $$R_G(t,\bfx) = g_3(t,\bfx) = (t,G\bfx)$$</li>
</ul>

<h5>Uniform motion Galilean transformations</h5>
First let's verify that a uniform motion transformation \(U_\bfv\) is indeed galilean:
<ul>
    <li>\(U_\bfv\) clearly preserves time intervals since it does not alter the time coordinate \(t\).</li>
    <li>If \((t,\bfx),(t,\bfy)\in\G\) are two simultaneous events then
        \((\bfx+\bfv t)-(\bfy+\bfv t)=\bfx-\bfy\),
        so \(U_\bfv\) preserves the distance between simultaneous events.
    </li>
</ul>
Thus \(U_\bfv\) is galilean.
<p></p>
Let's look at the parameter \(\bfv\):
\begin{align}
U_{\mathbf{v+w}}(t, \bfx) & = (t, \bfx+(\bfv+\mathbf{w})t) \\
& = (t, \bfx + \bfv t + \mathbf{w}t) \\
& = U_{\bfv}(t, \bfx + \mathbf{w}t) \\
& = U_{\bfv}\circ U_{\mathbf{w}} (t, \bfx)
\end{align}
which implies that
\begin{align}
U: \Rthree & \rightarrow Galilean\left(\G\right) \\
\bfv & \mapsto U_{\bfv}
\end{align}
is a group homomorphism which is clearly injective.
Note that \(\Rthree\) is abelian, and therefore so is the image of \(U\);
this is also clear from the calculation above.
From this we also get \(U_\bfv^{-1}=U_\mathbf{-v}\).
<p></p>
When looking at our Galilean space \(\G\) as \(\Rto{4}\),
if \(\bfv\in\Rthree\) is the (column) vector \((v_1,v_2,v_3)\)
then \(U_\bfv\) is represented by the matrix
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
v_1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
v_2 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
v_3 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
This gives an embedding of \(\Rthree\) in \(\mathbf{GL}_4(\R)\).
The same extends more generally to an embedding of \(\Rn\) in \(\mathbf{GL}_{n+1}(\R)\).

<h5>Translation Galilean transformations</h5>
Note that these are nothing more than the affine parallel displacements of \(\Rto{4}\) operating
on \(\G\).
<p></p>
Clearly \(T_{(s+s',\bfs+\mathbf{s'})} = T_{(s,\bfs)}+T_{(s',\mathbf{s'})}\)
and \(T_{(s,\bfs)}^{-1}=T_{(-s,\mathbf{-s})}\).
In particular the map \(T:(s,\bfs)\mapsto T_(s,\bfs)\) is a group homomorphism, in fact a monomorphism,
embedding the group of parallel displacements \(\G\) as an abelian subgroup of \(Galilean\left(\G\right)\).
Note, however, that with the exception of \(T_{(0,\mathbf{0})}\),
\(T_(s,\bfs)\) is not a linear transformation as it does not preserve the origin.

<h5>Rotation Galilean transformations</h5>
The map \(G\mapsto R_G\) is an embedding of \(\mathbf{O}_3(\R)\) in \(Galilean\left(\G\right)\).
The image of this map does consist of linear transformations with \(G\) mapped to the matrix
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & G \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
viewed as an element of \(\mathbf{GL}(\G)\).

<h5>Do uniform motion and translation transformations commute?</h5>
$$ U_{\bfv}\circ T_{(s, \bfs)}(t, \bfx) = U_{\bfv}(t+s, \bfx+\bfs) = \left(t+s, \bfx+\bfs+\bfv\cdot(t+s)\right) $$
whereas
$$ T_{(s, \bfs)}\circ U_{\bfv}(t, \bfx) = T_{(s, \bfs)}(t,\bfx+\bfv t) = (t+s,\bfx+\bfs+\bfv t) $$
so that
$$ U_{\bfv}\circ T_{(s, \bfs)}=T_{(0, \bfv s)}\circ T_{(s, \bfs)}\circ U_{\bfv}.$$
Thus \(U_{\bfv}\) and \(T_{(s, \bfs)}\) commute only when \(\bfv s = 0\),
that is when either \(s=0\) (no shift in the time dimension) or \(\bfv=\mathbf{0}\) (the trivial case).
<p></p>
Using this observation we can construct other identities, e.g.
$$\displaylines{
    U_{\bfv}\circ T_{(s, \bfs)}
    = U_{\bfv}\circ T_{(0, \bfs)}\circ T_{(s, \mathbf{0})}
    = T_{(0, \bfs)}\circ U_{\bfv}\circ T_{(s, \mathbf{0})}\\
    T_{(s, \bfs)}\circ U_{\bfv}
    = T_{(s, \mathbf{0})}\circ T_{(0, \bfs)}\circ U_{\bfv}
    = T_{(s, \mathbf{0})}\circ U_{\bfv}\circ T_{(0, \bfs)}.
}$$

<h5>Do translation and rotation transformations commute?</h5>
\begin{align}
R_G\circ T_{(s, \bfs)}(t, \bfx) & = R_G(t+s, \bfx+\bfs) \\
& = \left(t+s, G(\bfx+\bfs)\right) \\
& = T_{(s, \mathbf{0})}\left(t, G(\bfx+\bfs)\right) \\
& = T_{(s, \mathbf{0})} \circ R_G(t, \bfx+\bfs) \\
& = T_{(s, \mathbf{0})} \circ R_G \circ T_{(0, \bfs)}(t, \bfx)
\end{align}
Note that time-translation (i.e. when \(\bfs=\mathbf{0})\) and rotation transformations do commute:
$$R_G\circ T_{(s, \mathbf{0})} = T_{(s, \mathbf{0})} \circ R_G$$
This is expected because time-translations act on the \(\R\) part of \(\G\)
whereas rotations act on the \(\Rthree\) part of \(\G\).

<h5>Do uniform motion and rotation transformations commute?</h5>
\begin{align}
R_G\circ U_{\bfv}(t, \bfx)  & = R_G(t, \bfx+\bfv t) \\
& = \left(t, G(\bfx+\bfv t)\right) \\
& = \left(t, G(\bfx)+G(\bfv t)\right) \\
& = U_{G(\bfv)}\left(t,G(\bfx)\right) \\
& = U_{G(\bfv)}\circ R_G(t,\bfx).
\end{align}
Note that \(R_G\) and \(U_{\bfv}\) do commute when \(\bfv\) is a fixed-point of \(G\).
This can happen non-trivially when \(G\) is a reflection along the line passing through \(\bfv\).
<h4>
PROBLEM. Every galilean transformation of \(\G\) can be written uniquely way as the composition of a rotation, a translation,
and a uniform motion
</h4>

<h4>PROBLEM. All Galilean structures are isomorphic</h4>
Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be two Galilean structures.
Pick any two point \(x_0\in X\) and \(y_0\in Y\).
We define a map \(\chi:X\rightarrow Y\) as follows:
<ul>
    <li>\(\chi(x_0) = y_0\)</li>
    <li>
        Given \(x\in X\) there is a unique \(v\in\Rto{4}\) such that \(x=x_0+v\),
        and we define \(\chi(x) = y_0+v\).
        Note that for \(x=x_0\) this agrees with the definition above,
        that is \(v=0\) and therefore \(\chi(x_0) = y_0\).
    </li>
</ul>
The map \(\chi\) is an isomorphism of Galilean structures.
Indeed, by definition of affine spaces \(\chi\) is one-to-one and by construction satisfies
\(\chi(x)-\chi(x_0)=x-x_0\).
It follows then that \(\chi(x')-\chi(x)=x'-x\) for every \(x,x'\in\mathbf{A}\), 
so \(\chi\) preserves the Galilean structure.

<h3>C Motion, velocity, acceleration</h3>
If \(\phi\) is a Galilean transformation on \(\G\) then \(\phi\) extends naturally to
a transformation on \(\GN\), which we also denote by \(\phi\). Indeed, consider the following
diagram:
\begin{CD}
\GN @. \GN\\
@VVV @VVV\\
\left(\G\right)^n @>\phi^n>> \left(\G\right)^n
\end{CD}
where the vertical arrows send \((t,\mathbf{x_1}, \dots, \mathbf{x_n})\) to
\(\left((t,\mathbf{x_1}), \dots, (t,\mathbf{x_n})\right)\).
<p></p>

<h3>D Newton's equations</h3>

<h3>E Constraints imposed by the principle of relativity</h3>
<h4>Example 1</h4>
Assume that \(\bfx=\varphi(t)\) is a solution of equation (1)
and denote by \(\varphi_s\) the function mapping \(t\mapsto \varphi(t+s)\).
Then, as discussed in the book, \(\bfx=\varphi_s(t)\) is a solution of equation (1) as well, that is
$$\ddot{\varphi}_s(t)=\mathbf{F}\left(\dot{\varphi}_s(t), \varphi_s(t), t\right).$$
From the chain rule we get
\(\dot{\varphi}_s(t)=\dot{\varphi}(t+s)\)
and
\(\ddot{\varphi}_s(t)=\ddot{\varphi}(t+s)\).
Plugging these identities into the differential equation satisfied by \(\varphi_s\) above we get:
$$\ddot{\varphi}(t+s)=\mathbf{F}\left(\dot{\varphi}(t+s), \varphi(t+s), t\right).$$
Changing variable \(T=t+s\) and using the chain rule this transforms into
$$\ddot{\varphi}(T)=\mathbf{F}\left(\dot{\varphi}(T), \varphi(T), T-s\right).$$
But \(\varphi(T)\) is also a solution of the differential equation, that is,
$$\ddot{\varphi}(T)=\mathbf{F}\left(\dot{\varphi}(T), \varphi(T), T\right),$$
and combining these two equations we see that
$$\mathbf{F}\left(\dot{\varphi}(T), \varphi(T), T\right)=\mathbf{F}\left(\dot{\varphi}(T), \varphi(T), T-s\right).$$
Now let \(\bfx_0,\dot{\bfx}_0\in\RN\) be two points of the form
\(\bfx_0=\varphi(t_0),\dot{\bfx}_0=\dot{\varphi}(t_0)\)
where \(\varphi\) is a solution of equation (1).
Then for any number \(s\in\R\) we get:
$$\mathbf{F}\left(\dot{\bfx}_0, \bfx_0, t_0\right)=\mathbf{F}\left(\dot{\bfx}_0, \bfx_0, t_0-s\right),$$
which, from the definition of the derivative, implies that
$$\left.\frac{d\mathbf{F}\left(\dot{\bfx}_0, \bfx_0, T\right)}{dT}\right|_{T=t_0}=0.$$
Finally, from the theory of differential equations we know that for any triplet
\((\dot{\bfx}_0, \bfx_0, t_0)\in\RN\times\RN\times\R\) there is a solution \(\varphi\)
of equation (1) which satisfies \(\bfx_0=\varphi(t_0),\dot{\bfx}_0=\dot{\varphi}(t_0)\),
and it follows that
$$\left.\frac{d\mathbf{F}\left(\dot{\bfx}, \bfx, T\right)}{dT}\right|_{T=t}=0$$
for every value of \(t\).
That is, \(F\) does not depend on \(T\).

<h4>Example 2</h4>
We start by looking at translations in 3d space.
For simplicity we will denote an \(N\)-vector \((\bfx_1,\dots,\bfx_n)\in\RN\) by \(\angular{\bfx_i}\).
Recall that each \(\bfx_i\) is a 3-vector, that is \(\bfx_i\in\Rthree\) and \(N=3n\).
<p></p>
Let \(\bfx_i=\varphi_i(t)\) (\(i=1, 2, \dots, n)\) be a solution for equation (1).
Let \(\bfr\in\Rthree\) be any translation vector and define \(\psi_i(t)=\varphi_i(t)+\bfr\).
Then, as discussed in the text, \(\varphi_i(t)+\bfr\) (\(i=1, 2, \dots, n)\) is also
a solution for (1).
That is,
$$
\angular{\ddot{\varphi_i}(t)}=\mathbf{F}\left(\angular{\dot{\varphi_i}(t)}, \angular{\varphi_i(t)}, t\right)
$$
and
$$
\angular{\ddot{\psi_i}(t)}=\mathbf{F}\left(\angular{\dot{\psi_i}(t)}, \angular{\psi_i(t)}, t\right).
$$
But \(\dot{\psi_i}=\dot{\varphi_i}\) and \(\ddot{\psi_i}=\ddot{\varphi_i}\),
so we get
$$
\mathbf{F}\left(\angular{\dot{\varphi_i}(t)}, \angular{\varphi_i(t)+\bfr}, t\right)=
\mathbf{F}\left(\angular{\dot{\varphi_i}(t)}, \angular{\varphi_i(t)}, t\right).
$$
Now for every points \(\angular{\dot{\bfx}_i}, \angular{\bfx_i}\in\RN\) and \(t_0\in\R\)
there's a solution \(\angular{\varphi_i}\) of equation (1) such that
\(\varphi_i(t_0)=\bfx_i\) and \(\dot{\varphi_i}(t_0)=\dot{\bfx}_i\)
for every \(i\).
Combining these two results we get
$$
\mathbf{F}\left(\angular{\dot{\bfx}_i}, \angular{\bfx_i+\bfr}, t\right)=
\mathbf{F}\left(\angular{\dot{\bfx}_i}, \angular{\bfx_i}, t\right) \tag{*}
$$
for every \(\angular{\dot{\bfx}_i}, \angular{\bfx_i}\in\RN\), \(t_0\in\R\), and \(\bfr\in\Rthree\).
<p></p>
Change coordinates as follows:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\bfy_1 &= \bfx_1+\bfx_2+\cdots+\bfx_n,\\
\bfy_i &= \bfx_i-\bfx_1\ \ \ \text{for}\ i=2, 3, \dots, n,
\end{aligned}
$$
keeping the \(\dot{\bfx}_i\)'s and \(t\) intact.
This indeed has an inverse:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\bfx_1 & =\frac{1}{n}\left(\bfy_1-\sum_{i=2}^{n}\bfy_i\right)\\
\bfx_i &= \bfy_i+\bfx_1\ \ \ \text{for}\ i=2, 3, \dots, n\text{.}
\end{aligned}
$$
Now define \(\mathbf{G}\left(\angular{\dot{\bfx}_i}, \angular{\bfy_i}, t\right)=
\mathbf{F}\left(\angular{\dot{\bfx}_i}, \angular{\bfx_i}, t\right)\)
and let \(f_j\), \(g_j\) denote the \(j\)'th coordinate of \(\mathbf{F}\), \(\mathbf{G}\),
respectively, for \(j=1,2,\dots,N\).
Let \(\mathbf{h}\in\Rthree\) be any vector and define \(\mathbf{r}=\frac{1}{n}\mathbf{h}\).
Then using (*) we get 
$$
\begin{aligned}
g_j\left(\angular{\dot{\bfx}_i}, \bfy_1+\mathbf{h}, \angular{\bfy_i}_{i=2}^{n}, t\right)
& = f_j\left(\angular{\dot{\bfx}_i}, \angular{\bfx_i+\mathbf{r}}, t\right)\\
& = f_j\left(\angular{\dot{\bfx}_i}, \angular{\bfx_i}, t\right)\\
& = g_j\left(\angular{\dot{\bfx}_i}, \angular{\bfy_i}, t\right).
\end{aligned}
$$
It follows, then, from the definition of derivative
(applied to each one of the 3 coordinates of \(\bfy_1\) separately) that
$$\frac{\partial g_j}{\partial\bfy_1}=0$$
(as a 3-vector).
This shows that \(\mathbf{G}\) does not depend on \(\bfy_1\),
which in turn implies that \(\mathbf{F}\) depends only on the "relative coordinates" \(\{\bfx_k-\bfx_l\}.\)
This proves the first part of the example.
<p></p>
We turn now to the second part of the example,
namely to the case of a uniform motion with velocity \(\bfv\in\Rthree\).
Let \(\bfx_i=\varphi_i(t)\) (\(i=1, 2, \dots, n)\) be a solution for equation (1):
$$
\angular{\ddot{\varphi_i}(t)}=\mathbf{F}\left(\angular{\dot{\varphi_i}(t)}, \{\varphi_i(t)-\varphi_j(t)\}\right).
$$
Here we used the previous results.
Let \(\bfv\in\Rthree\) be any uniform motion vector and define \(\psi_i(t)=\varphi_i(t)+\bfv t\)
for \(i=1, 2, \dots, n\).
Then \(\{\psi_i(t)\}\) is also a solution for (1):
$$
\angular{\ddot{\psi_i}(t)}=\mathbf{F}\left(\angular{\dot{\psi_i}(t)}, \{\psi_i(t)-\psi_j(t)\}\right).
$$
Since \(\psi_i(t)-\psi_j(t)=\varphi_i(t)-\varphi_j(t)\),
\(\dot{\psi_i}=\dot{\varphi_i}+\bfv\), and \(\ddot{\psi_i}=\ddot{\varphi_i}\) we get
$$
\mathbf{F}\left(\angular{\dot{\varphi_i}(t)+\bfv}, \{\varphi_i(t)-\varphi_j(t)\}\right)=
\mathbf{F}\left(\angular{\dot{\varphi_i}(t)}, \{\varphi_i(t)-\varphi_j(t)\}\right),
$$
and as before the theory of ordinary differential equations shows that
$$
\mathbf{F}\left(\angular{\dot{\bfx}_i+\bfv}, \{\bfx_i-\bfx_j\}\right)=
\mathbf{F}\left(\angular{\dot{\bfx}_i}, \{\bfx_i-\bfx_j\}\right)
$$
for every \(\angular{\dot{\bfx}_i}, \angular{\bfx_i}\in\RN\) and \(\bfv\in\Rthree\).
We follow a line of reasoning similar to that of the first part above
applied to the following change of coordinates:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\bfy}_1 &= \dot{\bfx}_1+\dot{\bfx}_2+\cdots+\dot{\bfx}_n,\\
\dot{\bfy}_i &= \dot{\bfx}_i-\dot{\bfx}_1\ \ \ \text{for}\ i=2, 3, \dots, n,
\end{aligned}
$$
The \(\bfx_i\)'s are left unchanged.
Define \(\mathbf{G}\left(\angular{\dot{\bfy}_i}, \{\bfx_i-\bfx_j\}\right)=
\mathbf{F}\left(\angular{\dot{\bfx}_i}, \{\bfx_i-\bfx_j\}\right)\)
and let \(f_k\), \(g_k\), be the \(k\)'th coordinate of \(\mathbf{F}\), \(\mathbf{G},\) respectively,
\(\mathbf{h}\in\Rthree\), and \(\mathbf{r}=\frac{1}{n}\mathbf{h}\) be as in the first part.
Then
$$
\begin{aligned}
g_k\left(\dot{\bfy}_1+\mathbf{h}, \angular{\dot{\bfy}_i}_{i=2}^{n}, \{\bfx_i-\bfx_j\}\right)
& = f_k\left(\angular{\dot{\bfx}_i+\mathbf{r}}, \{\bfx_i-\bfx_j\}\right)\\
& = f_k\left(\angular{\dot{\bfx}_i}, \{\bfx_i-\bfx_j\}\right)\\
& = g_k\left(\angular{\dot{\bfy}_i}, \{\bfx_i-\bfx_j\}\right).
\end{aligned}
$$
Thus when calculating the 3-vector derivative of \(g_k\) with respect to \(\dot{\bfy}_1\) we get
$$\frac{\partial g_j}{\partial\dot{\bfy}_1}=0.$$
So \(\mathbf{G}\) does not depend on \(\dot{\bfy}_1\),
and therefore \(\mathbf{F}\) depends only on the "relative coordinates"
\(\{\dot{\bfx}_k-\dot{\bfx}_l\}.\)
This concludes the proof of example 2.
